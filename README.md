# Imgur Album Downloader

A transformation of a previous script I wrote [here](https://github.com/crumpstrr33/random-stuff/blob/master/imgur_pic_downloader.py). This adds a web UI made with jQuery and Python's Flask module. I made this to practice. I had no experience before this so I'm sure this is just riddled with poor practices and inefficiencies. It would've made more sense if I just made a GUI with something like QT, but practice.

## If you want to run it:
**Make sure you have [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) and [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) for the Python scripts**
1) Clone this
2) cd into it
3) Run `python app.py`
4) Go to `localhost:5000`, it works on Firefox and Chrome

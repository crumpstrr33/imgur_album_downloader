# Imgur Album Downloader

A transformation of a previous script I wrote [here](https://github.com/crumpstrr33/random-stuff/blob/master/imgur_pic_downloader.py). This adds a web UI made with jQuery and Python's Flask module. I made this to practice. I had no experience before this so I'm sure this is just riddled with poor practices and inefficiencies.

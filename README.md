# Imgur Album Downloader

For large Imgur albums, you have to wait for their servers to zip the album which, in my experience, can take days. So instead here's a simple local web UI made with jQuery and Python's Flask module that downloads a given Imgur album to a local directory.

## If you want to run it:
**Make sure you have [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) and [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) for the Python scripts**
1) Clone this
2) cd into it
3) Run `python app.py`
4) Go to `localhost:5000`, it works on Firefox and Chrome
